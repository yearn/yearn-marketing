## Team Purpose:

Our team drives the promotional and marketing engine of Yearn Finance. We are responsible for increasing brand awareness overall, while also driving potential and recurring users to our products and community. We are a vital part of Yearn’s structure and **mission to make DeFi accessible to all.** We help bring in users and contributors and subsequently retain them, in turn allowing Yearn to grow and achieve its organizational goals.

## Team Objectives

- Build buzz and excitement for the Yearn Finance ecosystem of products
- Bring a regular cadence of ecosystem and product clarity
- Build messaging support for Yearn products and partnerships
- Set up functioning Marketing and Content Operations
- Establish an effective/consistent brand (Co-owned with Creative Studio Team)

## Team Roles

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Marketing Mind | These are the thinkers, the  strategists, the ones that pool all their creative resources into giving life to elaborate plans and tactics that can reach the desired goals.  | 
| Metrics Interpreter | They swear by the power of analytics – they live and die by the might of numbers and KPIs. These data-driven gurus will leverage hard mathematical information to come up with solutions, interpreting figures to glean otherwise unfathomable insights. | 
| Wordsmith | Every letter, every word, every sentence, and every paragraph matters. They focus on content creation that will attract, retain, and connect with audiences, and they will tell the stories that forge lasting emotional or intellectual bonds. |
| Relationship Builder | Prospects and users want to know they are valued, that their opinions matter. Relationship Builders are there to make sure that is the case. They engage with audiences through all available marketing channels, make them feel appreciated, listen and learn from their experiences, and turn that valuable feedback into ideas for potential optimization. | 
| Technical Architect | They know all the tools and how to use them to get the best results. They understand optimization for searches, landing page conversion rates, and every single part of the process that may need that very technical know-how. They favor efficiency and results over anything else. | 
| Creative Mind | They favor aesthetics above all things. They communicate through images and videos because artistic inspiration fuels their work. | 
| Project Manager | The taskmaster marketing generalist to help manage deadlines, team members, resources, and overall project mechanics is key to any efficient marketing team. | 

## Some of our responsibilities

- **Content Creation**

We create and distribute *valuable*, *relevant* *and* *consistent* content across social channels, media/press, business partners (DAOs/protocols), and across events. This content can include Medium/Substack posts, Twitter threads, virtual events, or meme creation [among others].

- **Organizing market research**

We complete R&D to better understand how our product currently performs. We  use quantitative and qualitative analysis to  monitor and assess user sentiment and identify areas of continuous improvement. Market research can be conducted in-house, where members of the marketing team conduct surveys and analyze data to ascertain which segments of the market should be targeted. Market research can also involve marketing team members directly speaking to users or potential partners or holding focus groups.

- **Managing and planning events**

Within the remit of our marketing team is the planning and management of a range of events, from online webinars designed to generate leads to product launches that will garner publicity.

- **Supporting other teams**

Because everything we do affects and is tied to other parts of the DAO, one of our key responsibilities is to support B2B, product, and Support teams in order to ensure these areas are prepared for any marketing activity.

- **Search Engine Optimization**

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of developing a marketing/technical plan to improve visibility within one or more search engines.

## How Do We Achieve These Responsibilities?

- **Listening to user needs**

To inform our strategy, it’s necessary to get close to our users and listen in order to find out what their needs are. We support the necessary means for receiving user feedback through internal and external channels. 

- **Track trends and monitor competition/ collaborators**

Similar to the previous point, it’s important to know the position of Yearn regarding the market and  competition. We watch the DeFi space to learn what others do best or to identify others’ mistakes in order to avoid falling into them.

- **Communicate brand values**

Conceptually, a brand is a representation of the feelings that the products show. The marketing team is responsible for creating and disseminating images, messages and ideas that best communicate the brand values. **We work with the Brand team on this endeavor.**

- **Searching for new (and helpful) marketing' tools**

Whether it is product management tools to help gather user feedback, analytics tools to track product success or marketing automation tools, it is imperative for our team to stay up-to-date on the tools we can leverage and own implementing them.

## Decision-making

We own decision-making pertaining to content creation and deployment and events, however we also follow the advice process whereby we solicit feedback from other cross functional stakeholders

## Communication

- We use the Marketing Telegram group to share all information.
    - This group includes stakeholders from other key teams like Design, Support, Translations, Web, and B2B Partnerships.
    - We refrain wherever possible from DMs in favor of transparency and communicating in the team channel.
- We solicit feedback from other Yearn team members by sharing key updates, ideas in the SSE Telegram group.
- We develop and share community updates (in relation to our work) and engage with the Yearn Community in Discord.

## Team Tenets

- **Transparency**

We aim to be transparent with each other, with Yearn and with our community.

- **Think Big**

We encourage big bold and innovative ideas!

- **Empathy**

We have empathy for our team, Yearn DAO, and the community

- **Bias for Action**

DeFi waits for no one! We emphasize speed and action when making decisions. We follow a horizontal model of coordination and encourage each member of the team to take single threaded ownership and leadership.

- **Collaboration**

We work collaboratively with the Design, Web, and Support teams and seek input/feedback from others when it makes sense to do so.
